# Stopwatch-using-Python
 The main objective of this project is to design Stopwatch and implement it using python. A stopwatch is a device that has the ability to measure the time intervals of events. The device is used when time periods must be measured precisely with a minimum of complications. Laboratory experiments and sport events like sprints are good examples. The stopwatch is simple   counting of numbers . It is timed in seconds and helps the user to understand how much time the user took to complete the task. In this stopwatch tkinter library along with time module is used.
